# Introduction
This site contains a series of articles exploring the application of data science to problems associated with climate change and biodiversity loss, with a strong emphasis on geospatial analysis and image processing.


There is also a theme here around sustainable food systems; a result of much time spent working on regenerative farms, and a recognition of the fact that in the context of the multi-faceted nature of the problem at hand, large-scale spatial datasets have a central role to play in informing and optimising the transition to cleaner food systems.

This is a personal blog, all views are my own.
